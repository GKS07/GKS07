# 👋 Hi, I'm Gaurav Singh

I'm a Data Science enthusiast with hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP, committed to transforming data into meaningful insights. My journey includes various projects—from building a movie recommendation system and credit card fraud detection models to creating a CNN-based brain tumor classifier.

Having completed internships and job simulations with companies like The Sparks Foundation, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, and PwC, I've tackled real-world data challenges using Python, R, and essential tools like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Power BI. My recent work includes customer churn prediction, building data engineering pipelines, and developing impactful visualizations in Power BI and Tableau.

Skilled in predictive modeling, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing, I’m always driven to find creative solutions and communicate insights that help guide decisions. Currently, I’m sharpening my cloud skills on MS Azure, with a solid foundation in SQL and MongoDB.

I’m always up for new challenges and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together or just want to chat about data science!🤩
